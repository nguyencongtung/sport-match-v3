To implement the SportMatch MVP as outlined, a single repository with a monorepo structure is recommended for simplicity, maintainability, and streamlined development. This approach keeps all components (frontend, backend, and shared utilities) in one place, making it easier to manage dependencies, deployments, and collaboration for a lean MVP. Below, I’ll detail the repository structure, rationale, and considerations for the SportMatch MVP, adhering to the provided architecture principles and tech stack (React Native, Golang, MongoDB, AWS, Gorilla WebSocket).

### 1. Repository Strategy: Single Monorepo
- **Why a Single Monorepo?**
  - **Unified Development**: A single repo simplifies version control, CI/CD pipelines, and dependency management for a small team building an MVP.
  - **Shared Code**: Common utilities (e.g., validation schemas, constants) can be shared between frontend (React Native) and backend (Golang) without needing separate packages.
  - **Faster Iteration**: Aligns with the lean MVP focus by reducing overhead from managing multiple repositories.
  - **Scalability**: A monorepo can scale for future features (e.g., team management) while maintaining modularity through folder organization.
  - **Alternative (Multiple Repos)**: Separate repos for frontend and backend could be considered for larger teams or post-MVP scaling but add complexity (e.g., cross-repo dependency updates, separate CI/CD setups) that’s unnecessary for an MVP.

- **When to Split?**: If the team grows significantly or post-MVP features demand independent scaling (e.g., microservices), you can split into frontend and backend repos. For now, a monorepo is lean and sufficient.

### 2. Proposed Monorepo Structure
The monorepo will house the frontend (React Native), backend (Golang), and shared utilities, organized to reflect the modular design principle. Below is the recommended structure:

### 3. Rationale for Structure
- **Modular Design**:
  - Frontend and backend are separated into `/frontend` and `/backend`, aligning with the modular principle.
  - Within each, features (User Profile, Find Friend, Chat, Matching, Create Match) are organized into dedicated folders (e.g., `/screens`, `/controller`, `/service`), enabling independent development and testing.
- **Scalability**:
  - The structure supports AWS deployment (e.g., EC2 for backend, Amplify for frontend) with scripts in `/scripts`.
  - MongoDB schemas in `/internal/models` are flexible for evolving data needs (e.g., adding team management later).
- **User-Centric**:
  - Frontend `/screens` and `/components` focus on intuitive UI/UX (e.g., swipe interface, chat UI).
  - Shared `/validators` ensure consistent data validation for a seamless experience.
- **Lean MVP Focus**:
  - Only core features are implemented, with clear separation (e.g., `/screens` for each feature).
  - Shared utilities reduce code duplication, speeding up development.
- **Real-Time Features**:
  - `/backend/internal/websocket` isolates Gorilla WebSocket logic for chat and match updates, ensuring maintainability.

---

### 4. Tooling and Setup
- **Package Management**:
  - For Golang backend, use Go Modules (`go.mod`).
  - For frontend, use Yarn or npm at the `/frontend` directory.
  - Example root `package.json` (if still managing frontend/shared with npm/yarn):
    ```json
    {
      "name": "sportmatch-mvp",
      "private": true,
      "workspaces": ["frontend"],
      "scripts": {
        "frontend:dev": "cd frontend && yarn start",
        "backend:dev": "cd backend && go run cmd/api/main.go",
        "deploy": "node scripts/deploy.js"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Version Control**:
  - Use Git with `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, `.env`, and platform-specific build files.
  - Branching strategy: `main` for production, `develop` for integration, feature branches (e.g., `feature/user-profile`) for development.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Use GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  - Example: Run Go tests for backend, React Native tests for frontend, and deploy to AWS.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Store in `/backend/.env` (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).
  - Use `react-native-config` for frontend environment variables.

### 5. Development Workflow
- **Phase 1 (4-6 weeks)**:
  - [x] Initialize monorepo.
  - [x] Set up `/frontend` with React Native, React Navigation, and AsyncStorage.
  - [x] Set up `/backend` with Gin Gonic, MongoDB Go driver, and JWT authentication.
  - [x] Implement User Profile (`/backend/internal/controllers/userController.go`, `/backend/internal/models/user.go`, `/backend/internal/services/userService.go`) and Swipe functionality (`/backend/internal/controllers/swipeController.go`, `/backend/internal/models/swipe.go`, `/backend/internal/services/swipeService.go`).
- **Phase 2 (3-4 weeks)**:
  - Add Chat (`/backend/internal/websocket/chatWebSocket.go`, `/backend/internal/models/chat.go`) with Gorilla WebSocket.
  - Implement Matching (`/backend/internal/controllers/matchController.go`, `/backend/internal/models/match.go`).
- **Phase 3 (2-3 weeks)**:
  - Build Create Match (`/backend/internal/controllers/matchController.go`).
  - Integrate AWS SNS for notifications and analytics in `/shared` (or a new Go module if needed).
- **Phase 4 (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Deploy to AWS (EC2/Lambda for backend as a Go application, Amplify for frontend).
  - Test and launch on iOS/Android stores.

### 6. Additional Considerations
- **Geolocation**: Store Google Maps API keys in `.env` and use `/backend/internal/utils` for geolocation helpers.
- **Security**: Implement JWT authentication with Gin middleware in `/backend/internal/middleware` and use `go-playground/validator` for input validation.
- **Testing**: Place unit tests in `/backend/test` using Go's built-in testing framework.
- **Analytics**: Store analytics events in a dedicated Go model/service for tracking swipes, matches, etc.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle no-GPS scenarios in `/frontend/src/utils/geolocation.js` and low-density match areas in `/backend/internal/services/matchService.go`.

---

### 7. Why One Repo Wins for MVP
- **Simplicity**: A single repo reduces setup and coordination overhead, critical for a 10-15 week MVP timeline.
- **Modularity**: Folder structure mirrors the five core features, ensuring clear boundaries.
- **Scalability**: Monorepo supports AWS deployment and MongoDB scaling without immediate need for microservices.
- **Engagement**: Unified codebase ensures consistent UX across swipe, chat, and match features.

### 4. Tooling and Setup
- **Package Management**:
  - Use Yarn Workspaces or npm workspaces at the root `package.json` to manage dependencies for `/frontend` and `/backend`.
  - Example root `package.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "sportmatch-mvp",
      "private": true,
      "workspaces": ["frontend", "backend"],
      "scripts": {
        "frontend:dev": "cd frontend && yarn start",
        "backend:dev": "cd backend && yarn start",
        "deploy": "node scripts/deploy.js"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Version Control**:
  - Use Git with `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules`, `.env`, and platform-specific build files.
  - Branching strategy: `main` for production, `develop` for integration, feature branches (e.g., `feature/user-profile`) for development.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Use GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  - Example: Run Jest/Supertest for backend, React Native tests for frontend, and deploy to AWS.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Store in `/backend/.env` (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`).
  - Use `react-native-config` for frontend environment variables.
