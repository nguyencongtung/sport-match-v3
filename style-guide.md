# SportMatch Style Guide

This document outlines the visual identity and design principles for the SportMatch application, ensuring consistency across the UI. This guide is consolidated from `user-flow-final.txt` and `UI-description-final.txt`.

## 1. General Design Principles

*   **Vibrant & Energetic:** The design should evoke movement, energy, and the excitement of sports.
*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** UI elements should be intuitive and easy to understand, reducing cognitive load.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent design language across all screens (colors, typography, iconography, button styles, interaction patterns).
*   **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Important information and actionable elements must stand out.
*   **Purposeful Animations & Haptic Feedback:** Use subtle, engaging animations and haptic feedback to enhance UX and provide responsive interaction.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast, legible typography, and appropriate touch target sizes.
*   **Loading & Error States:** Implement clear loading indicators and user-friendly error messages.
*   **Empty States:** Provide helpful, encouraging messages and clear calls-to-action for screens with no content.

## 2. Color Palette

*   **Primary Colors:** Sports-appropriate color palette (e.g., green/blue tones) that evokes energy and activity.
    *   (Specific hex codes to be defined, e.g., `#007BFF` for primary blue, `#28A745` for a vibrant green).
*   **Accent Colors:** Used for highlights, interactive elements, and notifications.
    *   (Specific hex codes to be defined, e.g., `#FFC107` for a warm accent, `#DC3545` for error/pass).
*   **Text Colors:** Ensure sufficient contrast for readability.
    *   (e.g., `#212529` for dark text, `#FFFFFF` for light text).
*   **Background Colors:** Clean and unobtrusive.
    *   (e.g., `#F8F9FA` for light backgrounds, `#343A40` for dark mode backgrounds if implemented).

## 3. Typography

*   **Font Family:** A single primary font family that is clear, legible, and modern.
    *   (e.g., "Roboto", "Inter", "Open Sans").
*   **Headings:** Bold typography for headings and key information.
    *   `H1`: (e.g., 28px, Bold)
    *   `H2`: (e.g., 24px, Semi-Bold)
    *   `H3`: (e.g., 20px, Medium)
*   **Body Text:** Adequate font sizes for readability.
    *   `Body Large`: (e.g., 16px, Regular)
    *   `Body Medium`: (e.g., 14px, Regular)
    *   `Caption`: (e.g., 12px, Regular)
*   **Line Height:** Optimized for readability across different text sizes.

## 4. Iconography

*   **Consistent Set:** Use a consistent icon set for sports categories and interface actions.
    *   **Sports Icons:** Recognizable icons for each sport (e.g., shuttlecock for badminton, soccer ball for soccer, running figure for running).
    *   **Navigation Icons:** Simple, universally recognizable icons (üÉè Swipe, üìÖ Events/Matches, üí¨ Chat, üë§ Profile).
    *   **Action Icons:** (e.g., `+` for create, `‚öôÔ∏è` for settings, `X` for pass, `‚ù§Ô∏è` for like, `üìç` for location, `üë§` for participants).
*   **Style:** Icons should be consistent in style (e.g., outline, filled, duotone).

## 5. Spacing

*   **Grid System:** (Implicit, but a base unit for spacing, e.g., 4px or 8px, should be used).
*   **Margins & Padding:** Consistent use of margins and padding to create clear separation and visual balance between elements.
*   **Component Spacing:** Standardized spacing between components (e.g., vertical spacing between input fields, horizontal spacing between buttons).

## 6. Component Styles (Examples)

*   **Buttons:**
    *   **Primary Buttons:** Strong primary color, clear text, rounded corners, subtle animation on tap.
    *   **Secondary Buttons:** Outline style or lighter background, less prominent than primary.
    *   **Social Login Buttons:** Use official brand icons and colors for recognition and trust.
*   **Input Fields:** Light gray border, rounded corners, clear placeholder text, distinct error state styling (e.g., red border, error message below).
*   **Cards:** Card-based layouts with clear separation of information, subtle shadows for depth, rounded corners.
*   **Navigation Bar:** Consistent height, clearly highlighted active state, notification badges.
*   **Sliders:** Dual-sliders for age range with clear numerical display.
*   **Multi-select/Tags:** Visual and interactive, with clear selection feedback (highlight, checkmark).

## 7. Imagery Guidelines
