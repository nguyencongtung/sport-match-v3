# SportMatch Future Iterations & Feature Ideas

This document outlines additional features and enhancements for future iterations of the SportMatch application, beyond the initial MVP. These ideas are consolidated from `user-flow-final.txt` and `UI-description-final.txt`.

## 1. Notifications

*   **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications for:
    *   New likes (when another user swipes right on you).
    *   Mutual connections ("It's a Connection!").
    *   New chat messages.
    *   Upcoming matches/events (reminders).
    *   Updates to joined events (e.g., time change, cancellation).

## 2. Enhanced User Discovery & Matching

*   **Advanced Filters on Swipe Screen:**
    *   Filter by distance.
    *   Filter by specific play level.
    *   Quick Sport Filter: A small, horizontally scrollable bar of sport icons at the top of the Swipe screen to quickly filter profiles by specific sports.
*   **Smart Match Suggestions:** Prioritize showing users with overlapping sports tags and skill levels. Visually indicate why a match is suggested (e.g., "You both play Badminton and are Intermediate!").

## 3. Event Management & Interaction

*   **Event Reminders & Calendar Sync:** Allow users to set reminders for upcoming events and sync events with their personal calendars.
*   **In-App Payments:** Implement secure in-app payment functionality for match fees. Design a clear, secure, and user-friendly payment flow with confirmation screens.
*   **Group Chat for Events:** Integrate a dedicated group chat feature within the event details screen for participants of a specific match to communicate.
*   **Social Sharing:** Enable users to share event details or their profile to invite friends via a link.

## 4. Gamification & Engagement

*   **Badges & Achievements:** Introduce a system of badges or achievements for milestones (e.g., "10 matches joined," "First event created," "Most active player"). Create visually appealing badges or achievement displays on the profile screen to encourage engagement.

## 5. Chat Enhancements

*   **Media Sharing:** Allow users to send photos, videos, and other media in chat.
*   **Voice Notes:** Enable sending short audio messages.
*   **Typing Indicators:** Show when another user is typing.
*   **Read Receipts:** Indicate when messages have been read.

## 6. Profile & Settings Enhancements

*   **More Descriptive Skill Level Scale:** Consider a more nuanced self-assessment scale (e.g., a 1-5 star rating, or a slider with labels like "Casual Player" to "Competitive Athlete").
*   **Advanced Privacy Settings:** More granular control over who can see profile information or send messages.
*   **User Reporting & Blocking:** Enhance existing safety features with more detailed reporting options and clear blocking mechanisms.

## 7. UI/UX Polish

*   **Dark Mode:** Offer a dark mode option for improved user comfort in low-light conditions.
*   **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to choose from a selection of themes or accent colors.
*   **Enhanced Animations:** Further refine animations for a more polished and engaging experience.
